Objective:

The Tamil Text Analyzer is a web-based tool designed to process and analyze Tamil text input. The tool focuses on three main functionalities:

1. Word Segmentation – The tool segments the input Tamil text into individual words.


2. Morphological Analysis (Placeholder) – A placeholder for analyzing the morphological structure of Tamil words (to be expanded in future).


3. Text-to-Speech (TTS) – The tool converts the Tamil text into speech, using the browser’s native Text-to-Speech functionality.



This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to deploy on any device with a web browser, including mobile phones via Termux.

Key Features:

1. Word Segmentation:

The Tamil text entered by the user is segmented into individual words.

It uses a simple, rule-based segmentation system where the input text is split by spaces.



2. Morphological Analysis (Placeholder):

A placeholder function is provided for morphological analysis.

Morphological analysis would break down words into their base forms, identifying the root and affixes.

This feature is still under development and can be expanded by integrating linguistic tools.



3. Text-to-Speech (TTS):

Converts Tamil text to speech using the built-in SpeechSynthesis API.

The speech output is in Tamil, providing accessibility to users who prefer auditory feedback.



4. Responsive Design:

The website has a mobile-friendly design, optimized for viewing and interaction on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

Technology Stack:

1. Frontend Technologies:

HTML5: To structure the content of the web page.

CSS3: For styling the page and ensuring responsiveness on various devices.

JavaScript: For implementing the core logic, such as word segmentation, morphological analysis, and TTS functionality.

SpeechSynthesis API: To convert text to speech for Tamil input text.

Workflow:

1. User Input: The user types Tamil text into the input area.


2. Text Analysis:

When the Analyze button is clicked, the text is segmented into words, and morphological analysis is initiated (currently a placeholder).



3. Text-to-Speech:

When the Speak button is clicked, the system converts the Tamil text into audible speech.



4. Output Display: The segmented words and placeholder morphological analysis are displayed on the screen.

Conclusion:

The Tamil Text Analyzer is an initial attempt to build a Tamil language processing tool.With its focus on accessibility and usability, this project can be a stepping stone for creating powerful Tamil language tools on the web.
